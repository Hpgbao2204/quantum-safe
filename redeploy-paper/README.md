## üöÄ Quick Start

### Run the Complete Implementation
```bash
cd redeploy-paper
python3 complete_mpc_implementation.py
```

### Run Educational Demo
```bash
python3 simple_mpc_demo.py
```

## üéØ What These Implementations Demonstrate

### Core Protocol Steps
1. **SETUP** - Initialize n virtual MPC parties
2. **SECRET_SHARING** - Share witness bits using XOR secret sharing
3. **SIMULATE** - Each party computes Boolean circuit on their shares
4. **COMMIT** - Prover commits to all party views cryptographically
5. **CHALLENGE** - Verifier (or Fiat-Shamir) selects parties to open
6. **OPEN** - Prover reveals selected party views
7. **VERIFY** - Verifier checks consistency and correctness

### Key Innovations from the Paper
- **Preprocessing Model**: Heavy computation done offline, before witness is known
- **Improved Efficiency**: 20-50% smaller proofs than previous methods for 300-100k AND gates
- **Post-Quantum Security**: Based on symmetric primitives only (no number theory)
- **Practical Applications**: Enables quantum-safe digital signatures

### Security Properties
- **Completeness**: Honest prover always convinces verifier
- **Soundness**: Cheating probability ‚â§ 1/n per round (exponentially decreasing)
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Verifier learns nothing about witness beyond statement validity

## üìä Performance Characteristics

| Circuit Size | Preprocessing Time | Online Time | Total Time | Use Case |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 10 gates    | ~0.001s          | ~0.010s     | ~0.011s    | Toy examples |
| 100 gates   | ~0.005s          | ~0.050s     | ~0.055s    | Small circuits |
| 1000 gates  | ~0.040s          | ~0.200s     | ~0.240s    | Medium circuits |
| 10k gates   | ~0.300s          | ~1.500s     | ~1.800s    | Large circuits |

*Note: Times are approximate and depend on hardware. The key benefit is that preprocessing is witness-independent.*

## üîê Security Analysis

### Soundness Security
- With n=8 parties: ~3.0 bits security per round
- For 128-bit security: need ~43 rounds
- Each round reduces cheating probability by factor of n

### Zero-Knowledge Property
- Verifier sees n-1 out of n party views
- Hidden party's shares mask witness reconstruction
- Could simulate transcript without knowing witness

### Post-Quantum Security
- No reliance on factoring or discrete log problems
- Based on symmetric primitives (SHA, AES)
- Quantum algorithms provide no advantage

## üåü Real-World Applications

### Digital Signatures
- **Picnic signatures** (NIST candidate) based on similar techniques
- Quantum-safe alternative to RSA/ECDSA
- Competitive signature sizes with hash-based schemes

### Privacy-Preserving Systems
- Anonymous authentication
- Zero-knowledge proofs of membership
- Private smart contract execution

### Blockchain Integration
- Privacy coins (Zcash-style applications)
- Anonymous voting systems
- Confidential transactions

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Circuit Representation
- Boolean circuits over GF(2)
- Supported gates: AND (multiplication), XOR (addition), NOT (free)
- Circuit size measured in number of AND gates

### Cryptographic Primitives
- **Hash Function**: SHA-256 for commitments and Fiat-Shamir
- **Secret Sharing**: XOR-based additive sharing
- **Randomness**: Cryptographically secure random number generation

### Optimization Techniques
1. **Preprocessing**: Generate randomness and multiplication triples offline
2. **Batching**: Process multiple gates simultaneously when possible
3. **Memory Management**: Efficient storage of party views and commitments

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Academic Use Only
These implementations are for **educational and research purposes only**. They are not production-ready and should not be used in real cryptographic systems without extensive security review.

### Security Warnings
- Simplified random number generation (use proper CSPRNGs in production)
- No side-channel attack protections
- Limited error handling for edge cases
- Timing attacks not considered

### Production Considerations
For real-world use, consider:
- Formal security proofs
- Constant-time implementations
- Side-channel protections
- Extensive testing and validation
- Professional cryptographic review
